/* Heroku */

- Create Login
- Do "Getting Started on Heroku with Node,js"

    - (Recommend creating your own app instead of the Getting Started app so you know what the file will look like)
    - Make sure to have a Procfile file
    - Make sure to have a .gitignore file (add node_modules and package-lock.json to file)
    - Make sure to have a package.json file
    - Make sure to have a server.js file
        - hostname = 0.0.0.0 (I don't know why but this is the only way I got the heroku url to work with my app)
- Connect Heroku with Github account 
    - Heroku > Deploy > Deployment method (click Github tab)
- Make sure you can gain access to the app through the browser on Heroku
